**Spatial Data Repository for ggOceanMaps. R package version `r packageVersion("ggOceanMapsData")`**

This is a spatial data repository package for the [**ggOceanMaps**](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps) R package. The package provides low-resolution shapefiles required by ggOceanMaps in [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) format. These shapefiles are placed in a separate package due to CRAN Repository Policy. Please see the [ggOceanMaps](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps) documentation for further information.
