**NOTE: This package is not used by ggOceanMaps any longer**

**Spatial Data Repository for ggOceanMaps. R package version 1.2**

This is a spatial data repository package, which was required by pre-2.0 
[**ggOceanMaps**](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps) R
package. The package provided low-resolution shapefiles required by
ggOceanMaps. These shapefiles were placed in a separate package due to
CRAN Repository Policy, but the issue has been solved through automatic
downloads in >2.0 versions and ggOceanMapsData has become obsolete. 
Please see the [ggOceanMaps](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps)
documentation for further information.
